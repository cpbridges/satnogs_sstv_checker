Here's a Python script that will help you download data from SATNOGS observations. SATNOGS (Satellite Networked Open Ground Station) provides an API that we can use to access observation data, such decoded images like SSTV (Slow Scan Television) images from the ISS. It can def be modded as a template for lots of other applications too!
